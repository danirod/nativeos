/**
 * \file heap.c
 * \brief x86 kernel heap
 *
 * This file implements a heap allocator designed to be used by the kernel.
 * The heap is a big chunk of memory where an application may allocate objects
 * dynamically.
 *
 * The current kernel heap implementation is a linked list of memory regions.
 * Each memory region has a control block as header (including fields such as
 * the size of the memory region or whether it's allocated or not), and a data
 * region as body.  The data region is the space where the application may
 * write to or read from.
 *
 * Whenever a new buffer is allocated, a free memory region is selected, and
 * it's split in two segments.  One of the segments has the requested amount of
 * bytes on its data region; the remaining part of the original memory region
 * is marked with a new control block in order to have it free for future use.
 *
 * Whenever a buffer is freed, the memory segment is marked as free.  Further
 * allocations may use this memory buffer again, even split it again.  This is
 * a fragmentation source because there may be a lot of small regions marked as
 * active, with small free gaps in between that canont be used to allocate
 * bigger objects.
 *
 * In order to reduce fragmentation, every time a memory region is deallocated,
 * the bounds of the memory region are checked to see if there are other free
 * regions adjacent to the one that's being freed.  If two consecutive free
 * regions are found, those regions are merged into one consecutive and big
 * memory region.
