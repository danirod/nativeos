/**
 * @file
 * @brief NativeOS main initialization code
 *
 * If you are reading this because you want to understand what happens when
 * NativeOS starts -- this is not the actual entrypoint. The main entrypoint
 * is the Bootstrap function located in boot.s. It contains some initialization
 * routines that can only be done in Assembly such as setting up the stack
 * before calling kmain. However, virtually you can consider the kmain function
 * the main entrypoint for NativeOS.
